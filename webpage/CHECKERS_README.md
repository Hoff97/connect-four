## Technical Details

### Implementation
- **Backend**: Rust with minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with WebAssembly

- **Board Representation**: 8x8 grid with piece type tracking

### Performance
- **WebAssembly**: Compiled Rust code for fast AI computation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for better UX

## Difficulty Levels

- **Easy (Depth 2)**: Good for beginners
- **Medium (Depth 3)**: Moderate challenge
- **Hard (Depth 4)**: Requires strategic thinking
- **Expert (Depth 5)**: Very challenging
- **Master (Depth 6)**: Extremely difficult

Higher depths mean the AI looks further ahead, making it more strategic but taking longer to think.

## Game End Conditions

The game ends when:
1. **Victory**: One player captures all opponent pieces
2. **Draw**: 50 moves without any captures
3. **Stalemate**: A player has no legal moves available

## Tips for Playing

1. **Control the Center**: Central squares offer more movement options
2. **Advance Carefully**: Don't rush pieces forward without support
3. **Create Chains**: Set up multiple capture opportunities
4. **Protect Your Back Rank**: Prevent easy promotions
5. **Think Ahead**: Consider AI's counter-moves before making yours

Enjoy playing checkers against the AI! üèÅ
