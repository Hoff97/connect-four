## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- wasm-pack (will be installed automatically by build script)
- A web server to serve the files (Python, Node.js, or any static server)

## Quick Start

1. **Build the WebAssembly module:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Start a local server:**
   ```bash
   # Using Python (recommended)
   cd webpage
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or using Node.js
   cd webpage
   npx serve .
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` and open:
   - `connect-four.html` for Connect Four
   - `checkers.html` for Checkers

## How to Play

### Connect Four
1. **You are Red pieces, AI is Blue pieces**
2. **Click on a column** to drop your piece
3. **Get 4 in a row** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to win
4. **Choose AI difficulty** from the dropdown menu
5. **Use "New Game"** to restart or **"Undo Move"** to take back your last move

### Checkers
1. **Choose your color** (Red or Black) and AI difficulty
2. **Click on a highlighted piece** to select it
3. **Click on a highlighted destination** to move
4. **Captures are mandatory** - orange highlighting shows capture moves
5. **Multi-jump captures** are automatically chained together
6. **Reach the opposite end** to promote pieces to Kings
2. **Click on a column** to drop your piece
3. **Get 4 in a row** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to win
4. **Choose AI difficulty** from the dropdown menu
5. **Use "New Game"** to restart or **"Undo Move"** to take back your last move

## AI Difficulty Levels

- **Easy (Depth 3)**: Quick moves, good for beginners
- **Medium (Depth 5)**: Balanced gameplay, default setting
- **Hard (Depth 7)**: Challenging opponent, longer think time
- **Expert (Depth 9)**: Very strong play, may take several seconds per move

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- **Backend**: Rust compiled to WebAssembly
- **AI Algorithm**: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- **Games**: Connect Four and Checkers with complete rule implementations

### AI Implementation
The AI uses a sophisticated minimax algorithm with:
- Alpha-beta pruning for efficiency
- Game-specific position evaluation heuristics
- Advanced threat detection
- Dynamic evaluation based on board control
- Optimized move generation for each game type

### WebAssembly Interface
The Rust code is compiled to WebAssembly and provides:
- Game state management for both games
- Move validation and rule enforcement
- AI move calculation with configurable difficulty
- Game result detection and draw conditions

```

### Building from Source

1. **Install Rust:**
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Clone and build:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd fourrow
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. **Serve locally:**
   ```bash
   cd webpage
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

### Customization

#### Modifying AI Difficulty
Edit the difficulty options in either `connect-four.html` or `checkers.html`:
```javascript
<select id="difficulty">
    <option value="2">Easy (Depth 2)</option>
    <option value="3" selected>Medium (Depth 3)</option>
    <option value="4">Hard (Depth 4)</option>
    <option value="5">Expert (Depth 5)</option>
</select>
```

#### Adjusting AI Heuristics
Modify the scoring in `src/four.rs` for Connect Four:
```rust
// Column position scores
let column_scores = [0.0005, 0.002, 0.004, 0.005, 0.004, 0.002, 0.0005];
```

Or in `src/checkers.rs` for Checkers:
```rust
// Piece values and position scoring
let piece_value = if is_king { 3.0 } else { 1.0 };
```

#### Styling Changes
All visual styling is in the `<style>` section of each HTML file. The design uses:
- CSS Grid for board layout
- CSS Gradients for modern look
- Flexbox for responsive design
- CSS Transitions and animations for smooth interactions
- Outline-based highlighting for clear move indication

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically:
1. Builds the WebAssembly module
2. Deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to the main branch

To enable GitHub Pages for your fork:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Push to main branch to trigger deployment

### Manual Deployment

To deploy to any static hosting service:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg
   ```

2. **Upload all files** to your hosting service:
   - `webpage/connect-four.html` (Connect Four)
   - `webpage/checkers.html` (Checkers)
   - `webpage/pkg/` directory (contains WebAssembly files)
   - `.nojekyll` file (for GitHub Pages)

3. **Ensure proper MIME types:**
   - `.wasm` files should be served as `application/wasm`
   - Most modern hosting services handle this automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"wasm-pack not found"**
   - The build script will install it automatically
   - Or install manually: `curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh`

2. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Ensure you're serving the files from a web server
   - Files must be served over HTTP, not opened directly in browser
   - Make sure you're in the `webpage` directory when serving

3. **CORS errors**
   - Use a proper web server (Python, Node.js, etc.)
   - Don't open HTML files directly in browser

4. **AI moves slowly**
   - Reduce AI difficulty level
   - WebAssembly runs much faster than JavaScript but still takes time for deep searches

### Performance Tips

- Use **Medium difficulty** for best balance of speed and challenge
- **Expert difficulty** may take 5-10 seconds per move
- The AI gets faster as the game progresses and there are fewer possible moves
